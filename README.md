# Eye_Disease_Detection_colab
👁️ Eye Disease Classification Using Deep Learning & Flask

This project focuses on building an Eye Disease Classification System using deep learning, transfer learning (MobileNetV2), and a Flask web application for real-time predictions.
The system classifies eye fundus images into four categories:
Normal
Cataract
Diabetic Retinopathy
Glaucoma
